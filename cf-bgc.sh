# This script will will do a blue/green deployment of an app to Cloud Foundry. #
# It assumes you are already logged in, if not make sure you run `cf login`    #
# before executing this script.                                                #
#                                                                              #
# This scrip can do the following things                                       #
# 1. Push the application                                                      #
# 2. Bind Services                                                             #
# 3. Set Environment Variables                                                 #
# 4. Map Routes                                                                #
# 5. Start the application                                                     #
#                                                                              #
# If a version of the application already exists in the org and space being    #
# deployed to this script will deploy the new application under the name       #
# <appName>-new.  The routes mapped to the existing application will be mapped #
# to the new version.  Then the old version of the application will be deleted #
# and the new version will be renamed to <appName>.                            #
#                                                                              #
# The scripts depends on a couple of environment variables being set.          #
# 1. CF_APP - This environment variable is set by default in IBM DevOPs        #
#    Services                                                                  #
# 2. ENV_VARS - Environment variables to be set.  The value should take the    #
#    form NAME1:value1,NAME2:value2                                            #
# 3. SERVICES - Services that should be bound to the application. The value    #
#    should take the form servicename1,servicename2                            #
# 4. ROUTES - Routes that should be mapped to the app.  The value should       #
#    take the form host1:domain1,host2:domain2,domain3                         #
# 5. CF_PUSH_ARGS - a string of arguments to use when calling `cf push         #
#    For example, pushing a specific artifact or setting the memory.           #
#                                                                              #
#                                                                              #
# To use this script in IBM DevOps Services paste the following Bash script in #
# your Deploy stage.                                                           #
